* HOME - index
* MENU - menu
* LOCATIONS - locations
* BAG (ORDER PAGE) - bag
* SUBMITTED ORDERS - orders
* EDIT STUFF - portal

Hello! The menu page shows the menu for all stores which can be edited from the
portal page (edit menu), all items can be added, edited or deleted, and you
can upload pictures, all of this is only doable by a manager (visitor user later
on in the README). To choose a current location just go to the locations page and choose
whatever location you want. A manager can add and delete locations from the portal
page. The manager can also add, edit, and delete employees, managers, and their
corresponding relationships from the portal page. The bag page, only available to
costumers will show the items added from the menu, and will add them to the
corresponding current location. Current location should always show at the top of
the page. Submitted orders will be shown on the orders page at their
current location, if you are a customer you will see the status of your order,
if you are an employee or manager you will only see orders from your locations,
so you must choose from the locations page. Orders are automatically updated
every 5 seconds. If the current location is not one of your locations clicking
orders will take you to locations. Orders can be seen and fulfilled at the
orders page once clicked on the corresponding fulfill button and from there can
be fulfilled. They could also be canceled from the orders page.

The visitor manager user will be:
  username: ‘visitor’
  password: ‘password’

Thank you.
